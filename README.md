# Windows `cmd.exe` alias scripts

These simple scripts will allow you to have persistent aliases for `cmd.exe` very much like `.basrc` or `.zshrc`.

## Usage 

### Install

1) Clone this repo

2) Edit the `aliases.cmd` , adding what you want or removing what you don't need

3) Edit `install.cmd` ,  ensuing that the `<path_to_repo>` is replaced with the real location of the fil

4) Run `install.cmd` either from `cmd.exe` or by double clicking in explorer.


### Uninstall

1) Run `uninstall.cmd`

##Notes

This edits your registry. Whist I am pretty sure that these scripts will not trash your registry, I can't be 100% sure. 

Run at your own risk, your millage may vary, works for me, etc, etc.
